Affymetrix chips, etc. This workshop will be divided into two sections: 
the first part will provide an introduction into the basic R commands 
under Linux and the second part will focus on the usage of Bioconductor 
packages for Affymetrix chip analysis (RMA, GCRMA, QC display, SAM, 
etc). Knowledge of the basics UNIX commands, as introduced in our '<a href="http://faculty.ucr.edu/%7Etgirke/Documents/UNIX/linux_manual.html" rel="nofollow">LINUX Essentials</a>' course, is required for attending this workshop.<br>

Our facility is currently maintaining a 64-CPU LINUX cluster to 
significantly reduce the running time of computationally expensive 
bioinformatics applications. For instance HMM searches of 100,000 
protein sequences against the Pfam database can be finished on this 
cluster within 3-4 days as opposed to 'impractical' ~200 days on a 
single processor machine! This seminar will provide an introduction into
 the usage of the different load ballancing and parallel computing 
systems that are available on our cluster. A discussion will follow to 
determine the need for future hardware growth and software requirements 
in this area.<br>

 In response to the high demand, the bioinformatics facility is offering
 a workshop for biologists with interest in learning a user-friendly 
database software for managing complex data sets from DNA array, 
proteomic, large-scale sequencing and other high-throughput 
technologies. MS Access provides a simple but efficient database 
environment for organizing large data sets without knowing any 
programming languages. It is also a very useful tool to pre-design data 
structures for future import into more powerful database engines like 
MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle. The software is usually preinstalled on 
every Windows computer with MS Office. A Mac version is not available 
yet. This introductory workshop will cover the following topics: data 
im/export, interoperability with spreadsheet programs like Excel, table 
relationships, filters, queries, calculations, table joining, duplicate 
removal, reports and forms. Active Server Pages (ASP) for designing web 
interfaces will not be covered. <br>

 Since their introduction to the biological sequence analysis community,
 profile hidden Markov models have become a standard for 
high-performance sequence search, classification, and alignment.  These 
basic functions can also form core components of protein structure 
prediction and genome analysis.  This tutorial presents an introduction 
to the process of creating and using profile hidden Markov models, 
followed by a discussion of the iterative search methods that enable 
particularly distant remote homology detection.  The emphasis will be on
 gaining a qualitative understanding the underlying technology, with 
only a small amount of mathematics. <br>

<b>The SAM HMM Software System (hands-on workshop)</b><br>
 The Sequence Alignment and Modeling Software System (SAM) is the HMM 
system developed at UCSC in Haussler and Krogh's seminal work.  It has 
been continuously improved since the introduction of profile HMMs, and 
now forms the core of our protein structure prediction efforts, and is 
used by many other research sites.  In this workshop, we will use the 
SAM programs to create and examine HMMs, align sequences, and search 
databases.  We will also use the SAM web servers for protein structure 
prediction.  Attendees are encouraged to bring their own sequence or 
sequences of interest for building and using HMMs <a href="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/sam.html" rel="nofollow">(web version).</a></td>
